My table contains some identifiers, call them ID1 and ID2 and the records look like as given over requirement doc.
 
Output of above will be like: Given Over Requirement Doc.
 
>Transformation Logic: Link ID2 = 3 to ID2 = 2 via ID1 = 02 and then ID1 = 02 to ID2 = 01 via ID2 = 2 in the first part of the example table.
Second part is single entry.
